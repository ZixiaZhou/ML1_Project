In our project, we focus on the development of a machine learning model for predicting hotel booking cancellations. The model aims to enhance hotel management in the hotel industry, mitigate the impact of cancellations.

We trained four models: Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, Support vector mechanism and Decision tree.

Next, we used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for decision tree model and employ the best hyperparameters into the model. 

In conclusion, we select an optimal decision tree for predicting hotel booking cancellations. This model enhanced the ability to accurately forecast cancellations and supports efficient hotel management.

For potential improvements and future research, exploring ensemble methods like random forests or gradient boosting may have better results due to their ability to mitigate overfitting and enhance prediction stability.
